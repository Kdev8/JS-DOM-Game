# JS-DOM-Game
A Simpe JS DOM Game to evaluate my JS skills at that specific moment. The JS App is from Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JS Course. 
However the code is done from scratch by me ( trying to apply JS skills from other courses ). Doing anything from scratch will 
give you an idea how much you know! And yes I know ES6 (classes, constructors, objects). The problem comes when YOU have to apply them
which is a totally different story.

#### Important Lesson learned: 
When interacting with the DOM make sure you first express the problem using JS variables and then change the UI which leads to better and more maintainable code. Making mistakes like this type of code helped me improve a lot!

### As of Now April 6 2019 I'm gonna commit to Github simple JS apps done from scratch by me and then what discuss what I've learnt after doing them.
