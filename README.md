### Important Lesson learned: 
When interacting with the DOM make sure you first express the problem using JS variables and then change the UI which leads to better and more maintainable code. Making mistakes like this type of code helped me improve a lot!

## Future Goal
1. Implement OOP or Functional JS together with ES6 and module bundling ( Webpack ).
